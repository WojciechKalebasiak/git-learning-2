					You know the rules and so do I<br>
					A full commitment's what I'm thinking of<br>
					You wouldn't get this from any other guy<br>
					I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br>
					Gotta make you understand<br>

			Never gonna give you up<br>
			Never gonna let you down<br>
			Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
			Never gonna make you cry<br>
			Never gonna say goodbye<br>
			Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>

		<section class="verse">

			We've know each other for so long<br>
			Your heart's been aching<br>
			But you're too shy to say it<br>
			Inside we both know what's been going on<br>
			We know the game and we're gonna play it<br>	
			And if you ask me how I'm feeling<br>
			Don't tell me you're too blind to see<br>
