                   			 We're no strangers to love
					You know the rules and so do I
					A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
					You wouldn't get this from any other guy

					I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
					Gotta make you understand
                </p>

			Never gonna give you up
			Never gonna let you down
			Never gonna run around and desert you
			Never gonna make you cry
			Never gonna say goodbye
			Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
